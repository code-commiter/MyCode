Although Raj, Ramesh, and Reeja are not Java experts, they seem to be capable of developing the framework because of their development background. However, A, B, and C are struggling to understand our requirements; it all seems like gibberish to them. It would be better if we could find replacement resources for them. Currently, we don't have anyone in our team with Java or Linux knowledge. Having a Java expert would be highly beneficial since we still need to develop pipelines using Maven, Gradle, and Ant, which are mostly based on Java.
