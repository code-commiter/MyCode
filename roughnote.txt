What We Do
Our DevOps team builds and maintains frameworks that automate CI and CD processes, ensuring consistency and efficiency. We provide shared libraries that allow teams to run CI pipelines easily by just giving parametersâ€”no coding required. For CD, we enhance the XLR tool to automatically orchestrate releases based on a user-provided config file.

How We Help End Users
We make both CI and CD processes easier, so teams can concentrate on their main tasks without worrying about creating scripts for building artifacts or deploying them. By automating these workflows, we enable teams to run CI pipelines and manage releases with minimal effort, leading to faster and more reliable deployments.
