Our DevOps team builds and maintains frameworks that automate CI and CD processes, ensuring consistency and efficiency across workflows. We provide shared libraries that enable teams to run CI pipelines simply by providing parameters, with no coding required. On the CD side, we extend the XLR tool into a framework that automates release orchestration based on a user-provided config file. This simplifies the release process, allowing teams to focus on their core tasks without needing to manage the details of the CD process.
