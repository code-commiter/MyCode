Here's a revised version of your message in better English:

"I was previously issued a parking pass, but I lost it during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, I have been using the car parking on a first-come, first-served basis. Now that we have moved to a new building, I would like to request a replacement parking pass as it is now mandatory. Could I obtain a new one, please?"

Or, in a more concise and formal tone:

"Request for Replacement Parking Pass

I lost my previous parking pass during the pandemic and have been using car parking on a first-come, first-served basis. With our move to the new building, I kindly request a replacement parking pass as it is now mandatory. Thank you."

Note that I changed "I missed obtaining a parking pass" to "I lost my previous parking pass" to better reflect your situation. Let me know if you have any other questions!
