While you argue that your optimized code reduces the loop count by 40 when the target parameter is 50, let’s take a closer look. Your find loop on the target parameter runs 50 times each time it’s called, and since you use this in three places, that results in 150 loops for a single set of parameters. For 10 parameters, that totals 1500 loops. So instead of saving 40 loops, your code is actually adding up to 1500.

I believe I’ve helped avoid a much larger issue here, and I hope you’ll consider that rather than approaching this as a conflict. Let’s work together constructively.
