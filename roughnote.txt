Team,

I hope we are clear on the expectations for the assigned epics. I’m sharing the PowerPoint presentation we used for our discussion, which includes the design and code templates. This should provide you with the information needed to start on your epics.

We can proceed with all three epics in parallel since they use the same conversion method. Please analyze the parameters for each pipeline, determine the required conversion logic, and document your findings.

To ensure we make the most of our time, we’ll divide the tasks as follows: some team members will focus on developing the core conversion engine and reusable logic, while others will work on pipeline-specific conversion rules,  logic and parameter documentation. This approach will help us work efficiently and meet our deadlines.

Please reach out to me if you need any assistance.
