Sivaram, some of the logic is missing from the code you've implemented. Shrijesh and I have to go through it line by line to verify that all the logic is in place. If this continues, it will be difficult for us to have confidence in your work. We expect more responsibility from someone with ten years of experience. You should take ownership of the story, conduct thorough research, and ensure everything works as expected. It is not productive for us to spend hours confirming the quality of your code. Sometimes, it feels like it would be more efficient for us to write it ourselves."
