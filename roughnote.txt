You argue that your optimized code saves 40 loops when the user provides 10 parameters and the target parameter is 50. However, looking closely at the code, you’re using a find loop on the target parameter that runs 50 times each time. Since this appears in three different places, your code actually loops 150 times for a single set of parameters. With 10 parameters, that adds up to 1500 loops in total.

So, while you mention saving 40 loops, the reality is that your implementation creates 1500 loops. You should really thank me for bringing this to light before it reached a larger review board. I’ll stop here.
